I provided the instructions for the requirements_writer and the circuit_search to Google AI Studio chat and added the following prompt to it to generate the instructions for the results_writer:

I need you to create instructions for a results_writer agent. This agent will read state['requirements_writer_output'] as well as state['circuit_search_output'] and use them to generate a working html file that summarizes the search results provided in state['circuit_search_output'] in a human readable and user friendly way. The results_writer agent is expected to create a visually clear and easy to understand html document based on the findings provided in state['circuit_search_output'] without making any assumptions or performing additional search. Give me a set of instructions I can code in while building this agent. The instructions should be in plain text. Instructions should address the results writer search agent as "you"
