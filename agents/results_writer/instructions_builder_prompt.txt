Used the following prompt to generate the instructions.txt file (this file is used as developer reference and is NOT required as part of the software functionality)

Give me the instructions for an agent called results writer agent. This agent will read state['requirements_writer_output'] as well as state['circuit_search_output'] and use them to generate a working html file that summarizes the search results provided in state['circuit_search_output'] in a human readable and user friendly way. The results writer agent is expected to create a visually clear and easy to understand html document based on the findings provided in state['circuit_search_output'] without making any assumptions or performing additional search. Give me a set of instructions I can code in while building this agent. The instructions should be in plain text. Instructions should address the results writer search agent as "you".
