Used the following prompt to generate the instructions.txt file (this file is used as developer reference and is NOT required as part of the software functionality)

Give me the instructions for an agent called requirements writer agent. The user will provide a brief high level query to find information on a given number of circuit examples based on NE555 timer component to be able to build them and to get them working as circuits on a breadboard. The requirements writer agent is expected to expand that user query into detailed requirements that should be provided in markdown format as the output. Give me a set of instructions I can code in while building this agent. The instructions should be in plain text. Instructions should address the requirements writer agent as "you".
